## 📦 Installation 📦

```bash
$ pip3 install ft-suite
```

---
## 🚀 Quick Start 🚀

### Finetuning

```python
from fts import FineTuner

# Initialize the fine tuner
model_id="google/flan-t5-xxl"
dataset_name = "samsung"

tuner = FineTuner(
    model_id=model_id,
    dataset_name=dataset_name,
    max_length=150,
    lora_r=16,
    lora_alpha=32,
    quantize=True
)

# Generate content
prompt_text = "Summarize this idea for me."
print(tuner(prompt_text))
```

----

## Inference
```python
from fts import Inference

model = Inference(
    model_id="georgesung/llama2_7b_chat_uncensored",
    quantized=True
)

model.run("What is your name")
```


## GPTQ Inference

```python

from fts import GPTQInference


model_id = "facebook/opt-125m"
model = GPTQInference(model_id=model_id, max_length=400)

prompt = "in a land far far away"
result = model.run(prompt)
print(result)

```
