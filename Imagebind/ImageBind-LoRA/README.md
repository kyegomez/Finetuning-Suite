# Unofficial ImageBind Fine-tuning with LoRA

This is an unofficial implementation of the ImageBind Trainer with [LoRA](https://openreview.net/forum?id=nZeVKeeFYf9) fine-tuning. To adapt this repository to your own dataset, 
checkout `train.py` and replace the `dreambooth` with your own.

Make sure to clone this repository recursively to include the submodules:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules -j8 https://github.com/fabawi/ImageBind-LoRA.git
```

For installation, please follow the original [usage instructions](#Usage).
Install `matplotlib` when using the `train.py` script without the `--headless` argument.

**Warning**: If you receive the following error -> "'FastAPI' object has no attribute 'debug'", upgrade `fastapi` to the latest version:

```bash
pip install --upgrade fastapi
```


## Inference

In `example.py`, you can find an example of how to use the model for inference. To try the `LoRA` fine-tuned model, 
change `lora=True` within the script. To try the original ImageBind model, set `lora=False`.

**example explanation**: The `dreambooth` dataset contains the classes dog3, dog5, and dog8. Since the original 
ImageBind model was not trained on some arbitrary number-naming scheme, it matches the wrong images with dog8 and dog5. 
However, the LoRA fine-tuned model separates the 3 dog classes, indicating it was successfully adapted
to the toy dataset. This approach distorts the pretrained features of ImageBind. To maintain the original embeddings,
we propose experimenting with the two-step fine-tuning approach described in 
[this paper](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=UYneFzXSJWh): linear probing followed by full model (or LoRA) fine-tuning.
ImageBind-LoRA support linear probing by passing the `--linear_probing` argument to `train.py`. Note that the training process
should then be split into two stages, passing `--linear_probing` in an initial training session, followed by `--lora` on training
completion. With `linear_probing`, no distortion to original pretrained features is observed. All classes are accurately predicted 
when setting `lora=False` and `linear_probing=True` in `example.py`. Given that the example is running on a minimal toy dataset (`dreambooth`)
and that the samples belong to a different distribution than the pretrained samples of ImageBind, we observe better outcomes than fine-tuning 
with LoRA. This would most likely not be the case when fine-tuning on larger datasets.

## Fine-tuning

To train the model, run:

```bash
python train.py --batch_size 12 --max_epochs 500 \
        --lora --lora_modality_names vision text \
        --lora_layer_idxs 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 \
        --self_contrast --datasets dreambooth
```

You can enable logging using `comet`, `wandb` or `tensorboard` by setting the `--loggers` argument to the chosen logger/s.
Make sure to install the respective logging packages beforehand as well as the necessary environment variables.

To specify the layers or modalities to apply LoRA to, 
use the `--lora_layer_idxs` and `--lora_modality_names` arguments. 
To override specific layer counts for a certain modality, you could target the modality specifically, 
e.g., add the following argument to specify LoRA for the first 6 layers of the vision trunk only:

```bash
--lora_layer_idxs_vision 1 2 3 4 5 6
```

To train on GPU (currently runs on a single GPU, but multi-GPU training will be added soon), set the `--device` argument:

```bash
--device cuda:0
```

The LoRA models used in `example.py` 
(checkpoints found in `.checkpoints/lora/550_epochs/` with postix `_dreambooth_last.safetensors`), 
was trained for ~2 hours on a 3080Ti with 12 GB VRAM, consuming 5.66 GB VRAM and ~4 GB RAM. The model converged to a similar state in less than 30 mins.

1.2 B     **Non-trainable params**

1.2 B     **Total params**

4,815.707 **Total estimated model params size (MB)**


We set the train arguments as follows:

```bash

# installed comet-ml:
#       pip install comet-ml
# and set the env variables:
#       export COMET_API_KEY=<MY_API_KEY>
#       export COMET_WORKSPACE=<MY_WORKSPACE_NAME>
#       export COMET_PROJECT_NAME=Imagebind-lora

python train.py --batch_size 12 --max_epochs 550 --num_workers 4 \
                --lora --lora_modality_names vision text \
                --lora_layer_idxs 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 \
                --self_contrast --datasets dreambooth \
                --device cuda:0 --headless --loggers comet
```

**Note**: To perform linear probing (optimizing the last layer of each modality's head only), maintain all arguments, 
replacing `--lora` with `--linear_probing` (Both cannot be set in the same run). 
On running `--lora` in the next training session/s, the checkpoint of the heads is automatically loaded and saved,
assuming the `--lora_checkpoint_dir` remains the same.

PyTorch implementation and pretrained models for ImageBind. For details, see the paper: **[ImageBind: One Embedding Space To Bind Them All](https://facebookresearch.github.io/ImageBind/paper)**.

ImageBind learns a joint embedding across six different modalities - images, text, audio, depth, thermal, and IMU data. It enables novel emergent applications ‘out-of-the-box’ including cross-modal retrieval, composing modalities with arithmetic, cross-modal detection and generation.
